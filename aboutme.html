<div
    class="aboutme"> 
    <p>Hi, I'm not French. I just like the way words sound in French - fancy. I come from Serbia, the land of many great talents but not so many people who recognize and nurture them. So now I live in Berlin, Germany.
        I thought that going to university and spending many tiring hours learning about other cultures and their ways of expressing and communicating would help me understand the world and people better. 
        And I was right - it did. Only now I have to carry a burden of knowledge that sometimes makes you depressed. Just kidding. Not! After graduating from the Faculty of Dramatic Arts in Serbia with a bachelor's and master's degree in sound design for all media known to mankind, I took a slightly different path. I started learning audio programming (which I still do) and building experimental toys for my own enjoyment and that of others. Then I found other guys who share the same passion at the University of Berlin, and the next thing you know, I became their colleague at the Kunst und Medien program.
        My curiosity and unwillingness to settle for just one thing, combined with my extroverted personality, successfully shaped me into a theatre person. </p>
